		<h2>Guidelines- Yoga for Pregnant Ladies</h2>
		<p align=”justify”>
			The first thing is to remember that every pregnancy is different,
			even for the same woman. It is always best to listen to the body and
			do only what feels right each day. Modify according to the
			practitioners condition, especially when trying new Yoga poses.
			Concentrate on maintaining good alignment and breathing. Asanas
			should be practiced with proper guidance or under proper supervision.<br>
			<br> 1.As a general rule, modify poses to make space for growing
			belly and find poses that are similar but less demanding to the body.<br>
			<br> 2.Blood sugar levels can dip more frequently in pregnancy.
			Although one is advised not to eat before doing Yoga, pregnant women
			may need to have a light snack or juices before class.<br>
			<br> 3.More attention should be paid to pelvic floor awareness
			in all asanas and pranayama practice.<br>
			<br> 4.Tune the body with the growing baby with slow rhythmic
			breathing and relaxation poses during the Yoga practice. Do modified
			versions of Balasana (Child), Marjariasana (Cat), Malasana (Squat)
			and Butterfly Yoga poses (Bhadrasana).<br>
			<br> 5.Focus on stability and strength, rather than flexibility
			and endurance.<br>
			<br> 6.Avoid asanas compressing the uterus (e.g. forward
			bendings or closed twists) or asanas overstretching the abdominal
			muscles (e.g. backbends).<br>
			<br> 7.Do practice open twists by moving from the head to the
			waist only. Restorative poses, such as Supported Bridge with pillows
			and Reclining Butterfly with pillow, generally offer similar but less
			demanding backbends.<br>
			<br> 8.Avoid inverted asanas, like shoulder/hand/head stand;
			compressing the abdomen in twisted standing poses like Parivritta
			Trikonasana and abdominal poses like Navasana and Naukasana.<br>
			<br> 9.No lying on your stomach asanas like Bhujangasana,
			Shalabhasana and Dhanurasana etc.<br>
			<br> 10.Avoid lying flat on your back if you feel dizzy, sweaty,
			nauseous or short of breath. Avoid raising the hands above your head
			if dizzy when standing.<br>
			<br> 11.Avoid Kapalabhati kriya or any such straining cleansing
			practices.<br>
			<br> 12.In pranayama avoid Bhastrika and Kumbhaka (retention of
			breath). Practice slow breathing techniques, such as the Yogic deep
			breathing, Anuloma Viloma, Ujjayi and Bhramari to bring focus, reduce
			stress, anxiety and preparation for child birth.<br>
