	<br>
	<div class="margin">
		<p align=”justify”>What a woman eats and drinks during pregnancy
			is her baby's main source of nourishment. So, experts recommend that
			a mother-to-be's diet should include a variety of healthy foods and
			beverages to provide the important nutrients a baby needs for growth
			and development.</p>

		<h3>Key pregnancy nutrition</h3>
		<p align=”justify”>A pregnant woman needs more calcium, folic
			acid, iron and protein than a woman who is not expecting, according
			to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).
			Here is why these four nutrients are important.
		<h4>Folic acid:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="folic acid.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>Also known as folate when the nutrient is found
			in foods, folic acid is a B vitamin that is crucial in helping to
			prevent birth defects in the baby's brain and spinal cord, known as
			neural tube defects.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>It may be hard to get the recommended amount of
			folic acid from diet alone. For that reason the March of Dimes, an
			organization dedicated to preventing birth defects, recommends that
			women who are trying to have a baby take a daily vitamin supplement
			containing 400 micrograms of folic acid per day for at least one
			month before becoming pregnant. During pregnancy, they advise women
			to increase the amount of folic acid to 600 micrograms a day, an
			amount commonly found in a daily prenatal vitamin.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>Food sources : leafy green vegetables,
			fortified or enriched cereals, breads and pastas, beans, citrus
			fruits.</p>

		<h4>Calcium:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="calcium.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>This mineral is used to build a baby's bones
			and teeth. If a pregnant woman does not consume enough calcium, the
			mineral will be drawn from the mother's stores in her bones and given
			to the baby to meet the extra demands of pregnancy, according to the
			Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Many dairy products are also
			fortified with vitamin D, another nutrient that works with calcium to
			develop a baby's bones and teeth.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>Pregnant women age 19 and over need 1,000
			milligrams of calcium a day; pregnant teens, ages 14 to 18, need
			1,300 milligrams daily, according to ACOG.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>Food sources: milk, yogurt, cheese,
			calcium-fortified juices and foods, sardines or salmon with bones,
			some leafy greens (kale, bok choy).</p>

		<h4>Iron:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="iron.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>Pregnant women need 27 milligrams of iron a
			day, which is double the amount needed by women who are not
			expecting, according to ACOG. Additional amounts of the mineral are
			needed to make more blood to supply the baby with oxygen. Getting too
			little iron during pregnancy can lead to anemia, a condition
			resulting in fatigue and an increased risk of infections.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>To increase the absorption of iron, include a
			good source of vitamin C at the same meal when eating iron-rich
			foods, ACOG recommends. For example, have a glass of orange juice at
			breakfast with an iron-fortified cereal.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>Food sources: meat, poultry, fish, dried beans
			and peas, iron-fortified cereal.</p>

		<h4>Protein:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="protein.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>More protein is needed during pregnancy, but
			most women don't have problems getting enough protein-rich foods in
			their diets, said Sarah Krieger, a registered dietitian and
			spokeswoman on prenatal nutrition for the Academy of Nutrition and
			Dietetics in St. Petersburg, Florida. She described protein as "a
			builder nutrient," because it helps to build important organs for the
			baby, such as the brain and heart.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>Food sources: meat, poultry, fish, dried beans
			and peas, eggs, nuts, tofu.</p>
		<br>
		<br>

		<h3>Foods to eat</h3>


		<p align=”justify”>During pregnancy, the goal is to be eating
			nutritious foods most of the time, Krieger told Live Science. To
			maximize prenatal nutrition, she suggests emphasizing the following
			five food groups: fruits, vegetables, lean protein, whole grains and
			dairy products. When counseling pregnant women, Krieger recommends
			they fill half their plates with fruits and vegetables, a quarter of
			it with whole grains and a quarter of it with a source of lean
			protein, and to also have a dairy product at every meal.</p>

		<h4>Fruits and vegetables:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="fruits-and-vegetables.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>Pregnant women should focus on fruits and
			vegetables, particularly during the second and third trimesters,
			Krieger said. Get between five and 10 tennis ball-size servings of
			produce every day, she said. These colorful foods are low in calories
			and filled with fiber, vitamins and minerals.</p>

		<h4>Lean protein:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="lean.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>

		<p align=”justify”>Pregnant women should include good protein
			sources at every meal to support the baby's growth, Krieger said.
			Protein-rich foods include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, tofu,
			cheese, milk, nuts and seeds.</p>

		<h4>Whole grains:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="whole grain.jpeg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br> These foods are an important source of energy in the diet,
		and they also provide fiber, iron and B-vitamins. At least half of a
		pregnant woman's carbohydrate choices each day should come from whole
		grains, such as oatmeal, whole-wheat pasta or breads and brown rice,
		Krieger said.

		<h4>Dairy:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="dairy.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>Aim for 3 to 4 servings of dairy foods a day,
			Krieger suggested. Dairy foods, such as milk, yogurt and cheese are
			good dietary sources of calcium, protein and vitamin D.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>In addition to a healthy diet, pregnant women
			also need to take a daily prenatal vitamin to obtain some of the
			nutrients that are hard to get from foods alone, such as folic acid
			and iron, according to ACOG.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>For women who take chewable prenatal vitamins,
			Krieger advised checking the product labels, because chewables might
			not have sufficient iron levels in them.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>Detailed information on healthy food choices
			and quantities to include at meals can also be found in the pregnancy
			section of the USDA's choosemyplate.gov.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Foods to limit</h3>

		<h4>Caffeine:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="caffeine.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>Consuming fewer than 200 mg of caffeine a day,
			which is the amount found in one 12-ounce cup of coffee, is generally
			considered safe during pregnancy, according to a 2010 ACOG committee
			opinion, which was reaffirmed in 2013. The committee report said
			moderate caffeine consumption during pregnancy does not appear to
			contribute to miscarriage or premature birth.</p>

		<h4>Fish:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="fish.jpg" width=50% height=300px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>Fish is a good source of lean protein, and some
			fish, including salmon and sardines, also contain omega-3 fatty
			acids, a healthy fat that's good for the heart. It is safe for
			pregnant women to eat 8 to 12 ounces of cooked fish and seafood a
			week, according to ACOG. However, they should limit albacore or
			"white" tuna, which has high levels of mercury, to no more than 6
			ounces a week, according to ACOG. Mercury is a metal that can be
			harmful to a baby's developing brain. Canned light tuna has less
			mercury than albacore "white" tuna and is safer to eat during
			pregnancy.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Foods to avoid</h3>

		<h4>Alcohol:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="alcohol.png" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>

		<p align=”justify”></p>
		Avoid alcohol during pregnancy, Krieger advised. Alcohol in the
		mother's blood can pass directly to the baby through the umbilical
		cord. Heavy use of alcohol during pregnancy has been linked with fetal
		alcohol spectrum disorders, a group of conditions that can include
		physical problems, as well as learning and behavioral difficulties in
		babies and children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
		Prevention (CDC).

		<h4>Fish with high levels of mercury:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="fish mercury.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>Seafood such as swordfish, shark, king
			mackerel, marlin, orange roughy and tilefish are high in levels of
			methyl mercury, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,
			and should be avoided during pregnancy. Methyl mercury is a toxic
			chemical that can pass through the placenta and can be harmful to an
			unborn baby's developing brain, kidneys and nervous system.</p>


		<h4>Unpasteurized food:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="unpasteurized.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>According to the USDA, pregnant women are at
			high risk for getting sick from two different types of food
			poisoning: listeriosis, caused by the Listeria bacteria, and
			toxoplasmosis, an infection caused by a parasite.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>The CDC says that Listeria infection may cause
			miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm labor, and illness or death in
			newborns. To avoid listeriosis, the USDA recommends avoiding the
			following foods during pregnancy:</p>

		<p align=”justify”>
			<b>#</b> Unpasteurized (raw) milk and foods made from it, such as
			feta, Brie, Camembert, blue-veined cheeses, queso blanco and queso
			fresco. Pasteurization involves heating a product to a high
			temperature to kill harmful bacteria.
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b>#</b> Hot dogs, luncheon meats and cold cuts unless heated to
			steaming hot before eating to kill any bacteria.
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Store-bought deli salads, such as ham salad, chicken salad,
			tuna salad and seafood salad.
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b> Unpasteurized refrigerated meat spreads or pates.
		</p>

		<h4>Raw meat:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="raw meat.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>A mother can pass a Toxoplasma infection on to
			her baby, which can cause problems such as blindness and mental
			disability later in life, reports the CDC. To prevent toxoplasmosis,
			the USDA recommends avoiding the following foods during pregnancy:</p>

		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Rare, raw or undercooked meats and poultry.
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Raw fish, such as sushi, sashimi, ceviches and carpaccio.
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Raw and undercooked shellfish, such as clams, mussels,
			oysters and scallops.
		</p>

		<p align=”justify”>Some foods may increase a pregnant woman's risk
			for other types of food poisoning, including illness caused by
			salmonella and E. coli bacteria. Foodsafety.gov lists these foods to
			avoid during pregnancy, and why they pose a threat:</p>

		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Raw or undercooked eggs, such as soft-cooked, runny or
			poached eggs.
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Foods containing undercooked eggs, such as raw cookie dough
			or cake batter, tiramisu, chocolate mousse, homemade ice cream,
			homemade eggnog, Hollandaise sauce.
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Raw or undercooked sprouts, such as alfalfa, clover.
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Unpasteurized juice or cider.
		</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Pregnancy diet misconceptions</h3>

		<h4>Morning sickness:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="morning sick.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>When a mother-to-be is experiencing morning
			sickness, the biggest mistake she can make is thinking that if she
			doesn't eat, she'll feel better, Krieger said.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>The exact causes of morning sickness are not
			known, but it may be caused by hormonal changes or lower blood sugar,
			according to the Mayo Clinic. This common complaint can bring on
			waves of nausea and vomiting in some women, especially during the
			first three months of pregnancy.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>And "it's definitely not happening only in the
			morning," Krieger said. "It's any time of day." To ease morning
			sickness, it's better to eat small amounts of foods that don't have
			an odor, since smells can also upset the stomach, she suggested.</p>


		<h4>Food cravings:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="cravings.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>It is common for women to develop a sudden urge
			or a strong dislike for a food during pregnancy. Some common cravings
			are for sweets, salty foods, red meat or fluids, Krieger said. Often,
			a craving is a body's way of saying it needs a specific nutrient,
			such as more protein or additional liquids to quench a thirst, rather
			than a particular food, she said.</p>

		<h4>Eating for two:</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="eating.png" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>When people say that a pregnant woman is
			"eating for two," it doesn't mean she needs to consume twice as much
			food or double her calories.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>"A woman is not eating for two during her first
			trimester," Krieger said. During the first three months, Krieger
			tells women that their calorie needs are basically the same as they
			were before pregnancy. During the first trimester, the recommended
			weight gain is between 1 and 4 pounds over the three-month period.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>Krieger typically advises pregnant women to add
			200 calories to their usual dietary intake during the second
			trimester, and to add 300 calories during their third trimester when
			the baby is growing quickly.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Weight gain during pregnancy</h3>
		<center>
			<img src="weight gain.jpg" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>"Weight gain during pregnancy often has an ebb
			and a flow over the nine months," Krieger said. It's hard to measure
			where pregnancy weight is going, she said, adding that a scale does
			not reveal whether the pounds are going to a woman's body fat, baby
			weight or fluid gains.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>When it comes to pregnancy weight gain, Krieger
			advises mothers-to-be to look at the big picture: During regular
			prenatal checkups, focus on the fact that the baby is growing
			normally rather than worrying about the number on a scale.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>The total number of calories that are needed
			per day during pregnancy depends on a woman's height, her weight
			before becoming pregnant, and how active she is on a daily basis. In
			general, underweight women need more calories during pregnancy;
			overweight and obese women need fewer of them.</p>

		<p align=”justify”>The Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines for
			total weight gain during a full-term pregnancy recommend that:</p>

		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Underweight women, who have a Body Mass Index (BMI) below
			18.5, should gain 12.7 to 18 kgs.
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Normal weight women, who have a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9, should
			gain 11.3 to 15.8 kg.
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Overweight women, who have a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9, should
			gain 6.8 to 11.3 kg.
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Obese women, who have a BMI of 30.0 and above, should gain
			5 to 9 kg.
		</p>

		<h4>Rate of weight gain</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="rate.png" width=50% height=350px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>The IOM guidelines suggest that pregnant women
			gain between 1 and 4.5 lbs. (0.45 to 2 kg) total during their first
			trimester of pregnancy. The guidelines recommend that underweight and
			normal-weight women gain, on average, about 1 pound every week during
			their second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and that overweight
			and obese women gain about half a pound every week in their second
			and third trimesters of pregnancy.</p>

		<h4>Twins</h4>
		<center>
			<img src="twin.jpg" width=40% height=450px>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p align=”justify”>The IOM guidelines for pregnancy weight gain
			when a woman is having twins are as follows:</p>

		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Underweight: 50 to 62 lbs. (22.6 kg to 28.1 kg).
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Normal weight: 37 to 54 lbs. (16.7 to 24.5 kg).
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Overweight: 31 to 50 lbs. (14 to 22.6 kg).
		</p>
		<p align=”justify”>
			<b> # </b>Obese: 25 to 42 lbs. (11.3 to 19 kg).
		</p>
