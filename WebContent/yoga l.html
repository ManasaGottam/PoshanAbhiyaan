		<h2>Principles of Yoga Practices in Lactating Women</h2>
		<p align=”justify”>
			There are several ways to increase milk production, one of which is
			by doing Yoga exercise. Yoga is a unique combination of useful
			movements to improve physical health and way of breathing and
			meditation that can provide peace of mind.<br>
			<br> According to Yoga exercisesfor breast feeding mothers
			include:<br>
			<br> 1) Sukshma Vyayama Kriya:<br> This has benefits to
			improve blood circulation around the breasts, strengthen the
			supporting muscles of breasts, strengthen the supporting muscles for
			respiration, and open the chest cavity in all directions.<br>
			<br> 2) Asana:<br> These practices focuses on stretching
			particular body parts and helps blood flow and stimulates hormonal
			glands (endocrine) in the body. Most importantly, Asana Yoga is
			useful to strengthen and purify the nervous system, especially the
			spine, so it will be able to improve health and sense of wellbeing
			not only in the body but also the mind and emotions.<br>
			<br> 3) Pranayama:<br> Pranayama practices synchronize the
			flow of energy all over the body. Breathing practices are very vital
			as they will maximize the capacity of the lungs during breathing and
			keep the air flow in the body running smoothly, so this can improve
			the strength and malleability of the body, relieve tension, increase
			the peace and generate new energy.<br>
			<br> 4) Relaxation:<br> The relaxation phase is useful to
			raise self-awareness. While doing one of the postures in shavasana
			relaxation, the gently pressed glands while doing asana will produce
			its hormones more stably, blood circulation flows more smoothly, the
			body will break down its muscle tension, the mind will become calmer,
			and the feeling will become more peaceful.<br>
			<br> 5) Meditation:<br> It is a state where “the body is
			still and quiet with total conscious mind of being here, now. The
			effects obtained from meditation are senses of calmness,
			peacefulness, safety, comfort, serenity, resignation, and acceptance
			of what is available.
